Related Issue: https://github.com/fadhilyori/subping/issues/23
Background During the development process of subping, our team encountered a critical issue involving a memory leak that specifically occurs when handling a substantial number of IPv6 hosts. This memory leak has a negative impact on the application&amp;rsquo;s performance and raises concerns regarding its stability and scalability.
We have observed that the leak becomes more pronounced as the number of IPv6 hosts increases.</description></item></channel></rss>
